# Dorox: Your Personal Virtual Machine in the Cloud

**Dorox** offers a seamless and innovative way to interact with virtual machines (VMs) directly from your browser or via SSH. With just a few clicks, users can spin up their own dedicated Alpine Linux VM, tailored for developers, tech enthusiasts, and educators seeking a secure, isolated environment for coding, testing, and deployment projects.

## Quick Start

Getting started with Dorox is as simple as creating an account. Upon registration, you're instantly granted access to a personal VM. Initially, your VM is set in a secure, internet-restricted mode to mitigate the risks associated with DDoS farms and ensure a safe, reliable service for all users.

## Tech

Dorox is completely written in Go (and some shell scripting)

## Exclusive Features

- **Web and SSH Access**: Dorox leverages cutting-edge technology to provide direct VM access through a web interface or traditional SSH, catering to both modern and conventional preferences.
- **Secure, Isolated Containers**: Each VM runs within a Docker container, offering a lightweight, yet fully-featured Linux environment.
- **Real-time Interaction**: Our platform utilizes a dynamic combination of WebSockets and SSH clients, bridging the gap between the web interface and containerized VMs for seamless, real-time interaction.
- **Scalable Task Distribution**: At the heart of Dorox is a Redis-based task distribution system, ensuring efficient management and scaling of VM operations.
- **Comprehensive API**: The backbone of our service is a robust gRPC-based API, providing a powerful, efficient, and versatile method for service interaction. For those who prefer traditional methods, a HTTP gateway is also available.

## Upgrade and Unleash Full Potential

For just $2, payable in MONERO, users can unlock their VM's full potential by removing internet restrictions. This upgrade not only allows for general web access but also enables hosting personal websites directly from your VM, offering an unparalleled cost-to-feature ratio in the cloud hosting market.
